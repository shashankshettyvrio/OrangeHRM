# OrangeHRM Playwright Automation Framework

## 📌 Project Overview

This is an end-to-end UI and API automation framework built using **Playwright** with **TypeScript** for the OrangeHRM application.

The framework follows the **Page Object Model (POM)** design pattern and focuses on clean architecture, reusable components, maintainability, and scalable test automation practices.

It includes automated coverage for authentication, dashboard validation, employee management, admin user management, logout, and authenticated API validation.

The framework also includes **GitHub Actions CI integration** to run smoke tests automatically on push and pull request events.

## 🔁 GitHub Actions CI

The project includes GitHub Actions workflows for smoke and regression test execution.

### Smoke Test Workflow

Smoke tests run automatically on:

- Push
- Pull request

Workflow file:

```text
.github/workflows/playwright-smoke.yml
```

The smoke workflow runs tests using a browser matrix for:

- Chromium
- Firefox

Smoke test command:

```bash
npx playwright test --grep "@smoke"
```

### Manual Regression Workflow

Regression tests can be triggered manually from GitHub Actions using `workflow_dispatch`.

Workflow file:

```text
.github/workflows/playwright-regression.yml
```

Regression test command:

```bash
npx playwright test --grep "@regression" --project=chromium
```

---

## ▶️ Installation

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Install Playwright browsers:

```bash
npx playwright install
```

---

## ▶️ Execute Tests

Run all tests:

```bash
npx playwright test
```

Run smoke tests:

```bash
npx playwright test --grep "@smoke"
```

Run regression tests:

```bash
npx playwright test --grep "@regression"
```

Run tests on a specific browser:

```bash
npx playwright test --project=chromium
npx playwright test --project=firefox
npx playwright test --project=webkit
```

Run mobile emulation smoke tests:

```bash
npx playwright test --grep "@smoke" --project=mobile-chrome
npx playwright test --grep "@smoke" --project=mobile-safari
```

Run employee E2E test:

```bash
npx playwright test "tests/Employee E2E/addeditdeleteEmployee.spec.ts"
```

Run API validation test:

```bash
npx playwright test tests/API/apiValidation.spec.ts
```

---

## 📊 Reporting

View the Playwright HTML report:

```bash
npx playwright show-report
```

Generate Allure report:

```bash
npx allure-commandline generate allure-results --clean -o allure-report
```

Open Allure report:

```bash
npx allure-commandline open allure-report
```

The framework captures screenshots, videos, and trace files on failure.
